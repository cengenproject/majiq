MAJIQ analysis conducted using script `src/majiq.sh`. To produce correct GFF format, this script additionally calls `src/add_gene_names.awk`.

VOILA modulizer separately ran with `src/modulize.sh` (not included in paper).

After MAJIQ has run, results are analyzed (and figures created) with `R/deltapsi.R`.

Other, more exploratory and accessory scripts are stored in separate branch.
